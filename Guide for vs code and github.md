⚠️ Step 0 — Before You Start

👉 Make sure you have accepted the Classroom link from Collin before doing anything else.
This creates your own private assignment repository inside the school’s GitHub organization.
If you skip this step, nothing will connect correctly later!

“How to connect VS Code to GitHub on Windows”
🎯 Goal

Show how to:

Install Git on Windows

Sign in to GitHub from VS Code

Clone or upload a project

No terminal commands required at all.

🪄 Step 1 — Install Git

Narration:

“Before VS Code can talk to GitHub, we need Git — the program that does the saving and syncing.”

Visuals:

Go to git-scm.com → click Download for Windows.

Run the installer → keep every default option.

When finished, click Finish and close the installer.

Restart VS Code so it recognizes Git.

Install Git on Windows through Visual Studio Code. That is the best way to do it. If you do not understand Pull Requests and Issues extension. Just google it or use AI to help you with that. I can help you if you want!

Pause and install!!






🔐 Step 2 — Sign in to GitHub from VS Code

Narration:

“Now we’ll connect VS Code to your GitHub account so you can push and pull your code.”

Visuals:

In VS Code, click the Account icon (bottom-left corner).

Choose ‘Sign in to GitHub’.

A browser window opens → click Authorize Visual Studio Code.

Return to VS Code — your GitHub username now appears in the corner. ✅








🗂️ Step 3 — Open or clone your project

Narration:

“Let’s bring a project into VS Code.”

Visuals:

To clone from GitHub:

Press Ctrl + Shift + P.

Type ‘Git: Clone’.

Paste your GitHub repo link.

Choose a folder → click ‘Open’.

To start a new project:

Click File → New Folder.

Open that folder in VS Code.

Add some files to it.



💾 Step 4 — Publish to GitHub

Narration:

“Now we’ll send the project up to GitHub.”

Visuals:

Open the Source Control panel (branch icon on left).

Click ‘Publish to GitHub’.

Pick a name → choose Public or Private → click ‘Publish Repository’.

VS Code creates the repo on GitHub and pushes your files automatically. 🎉

(You’ll see the confirmation link appear in the Output panel — click to open it in GitHub.)


Make sure that your index files where you have your project is saved in the correct folder. 

everything that you do in this folder, add something or delete, when you commit, it will change on github. 

For ex. If you were to add a picture in the folder, that picture would uppload to your Repo. 

Hm, we will see if i did something wrong. Hopfully you have followed this guide and everything works for you. I will try to debug... 

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

The problem seams to be that i already have one repo connected...
