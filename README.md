## Simple offline glossary app built with JavaScript

When I started this project, I had big expectations. I wanted to build something that could store words, test translations, and maybe even save progress. Pretty soon I realised it was better to just focus on getting small things to work first, one step at a time.

GlossyHelper is a small offline glossary app I’m building in JavaScript as part of my programming and English studies.
It’s not fancy or big, just something I’m creating to learn more about coding and build something useful at the same time.


## Features (so far)

Add words in Swedish and English.

See the words lis.

Test yourself in both directions.

See feedback instantly: “Correct!” or the right answer.

Simple pop-ups and alerts for interaction.

Keeps running in a small loop until you choose to quit.

It’s built only with the basics: prompts for input, alerts for feedback, and text written directly to the page. It’s not pretty, but it works, almost.

## What I am corrently working on now. 

Create a local storage with the added words list.

I will add a locally stored words list to the menu.
In the future, I might also add options to upload and download the words list.

Everything will still be handled through a prompt.

It would be good to be able to edit the words list, or at least delete it.
If that isn’t possible, the user will have to open and edit the JSON file manually.

This is based from a stack overflow thread : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage

## Problems at the moment
No problems at the moment!


## Planned ideas

Cleaner layout and design.

Handling synonyms and saving data.

Import and export of word lists.

*For now, I’m just happy that it finally runs without errors and does most of the things i want.*
