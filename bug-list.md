1. Problem: Make a list that the user can read. I made it first with documentwrite and it created all sorts of problem
Now i try to do it in a prompt instead!
I made and array and displayed it with an prompt and now it is working!

2. I added a fourth option to the menu (local storage). When I refresh the page, it is not there..
