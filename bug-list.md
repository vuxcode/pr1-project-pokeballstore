1. Problem: Make a list that the user can read. I made it first with documentwrite and it created all sorts of problem
Now i try to do it in a prompt instead!
I made and array and displayed it with an prompt and now it is working!

2. I added a fourth option to the menu (local storage). When I refresh the page, it is not there.. 
 GitHub page was just slow at updating 

3. In my new submenu, I was supposed to go back to the main menu, but I accidentally set the boolean to exit the program instead.
 "Removed the boolean and added return;."

 4. Tried to add document.write to display "refresh page to start Glossyhelper" when quitting the program.
