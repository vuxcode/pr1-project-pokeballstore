// ====== DATA ======

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ====== Local storage ====== When program starts, check if there's saved data in localStorage .getitem
if (localStorage.getItem("glossary") !== null) { // If "!== null" FALSE (nothing stored) -> skip this code, program continues with empty glossary

// ====== FUNCTIONS ======

//   ==== Add words ====

function addWord() {  // function is a block of code that performs a specific task // Can we reuse functions? in this case addWord. // it will be number 1 in the "prompt menu"
  var swe = prompt("Enter a Swedish word:"); // add a word in Swedish first
  var eng = prompt("Enter English translation:"); // then add its English translation
  // Lets see if we can add the words to the .json
  glossary.push({ swedish: swe, english: eng }); // When the user adds a word it goes to swedish or english push adds a new element to the end of an array. But collin dont want to call it element.. dont remember what he said.
  alert("Word added: " + swe + " -> " + eng); // Can i make symbols? insted instead of ->  use an arrow? or something else that suits better?
   localStorage.setItem("glossary", JSON.stringify(glossary));
}
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


//   ==== The Words List ====

function listWords() { // this will list all words that have been added to the glossary on the page in html via document write. for now . // it will be number 2 in the "prompt menu"
// lets try to make the wordslist in a prompt. If i direct towards glossary it creates just a prompt with object object. Need to "format the var glossary"

  if (glossary.length === 0) { // if there are no words in the glossary = "=== 0" 
   alert("No words added yet."); // This will be written in a prompt
   return; // Stop the function and start over instead of using else
  } 
    var listText = "Glossary:\n\n"; // Creating a new var "listText" where the list will be formated. do i need to put this at the top of the program?
      for (var i = 0; i < glossary.length; i++) { // The index "i" starts at 0 (Lesson 07 - Loops).
// i++ makes it increase by 1 each time, so the loop continues until all words are listed.
    listText += (i + 1) + ". " + glossary[i].swedish + " → " + glossary[i].english + "\n"; // Now we make a list by adding one word at a time. The "(i +1)" make it start the count from 1 instead of 0
// "+=" means we keep what we already have and add more on the next line using "\n".
// On the left side is the Swedish word and on the right side the English word. We will see this in the prompt box.
 
  }
   // Show the list inside a PROMPT
  prompt(listText + "\n(Press OK to return to menu)"); // List \n creates a new line Ok to return is the message.
}
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


//   ==== The Quiz ====

function startQuiz() { // this will start a quiz where the user can test their knowledge of the words in the glossary. // it will be number 3 in the "prompt menu"
  if (glossary.length === 0) { // if there are no words in the glossary = "=== 0"

    alert("Invalid choice."); // Give the user an alert
    return; // Give the user a new chance
  }

  // pick a random word
  var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * glossary.length); // Math.random() gives a random number between 0 and 1. Math.floor() rounds down to the nearest whole number to make it work with, glossary.length, that gives the number of words in the glossary.
  var word = glossary[index]; // glossary[index] picks the random word object from the array.

  if (direction === "1") { // If direction is "1", the quiz asks to translate from Swedish to English. If "2", the quiz asks to translate from English to Swedish.

    checkAnswer(answer, word.english); // checkAnswer function checks if the answer is correct.
  } else {
    var answer = prompt("Translate into Swedish: " + word.english[0]); // If "2" is chosen by user, the quiz asks to translate from English to Swedish.

  }
}

  } else {

  }

//   ==== Add and delete storage ====

  } else if (choice === "5") {
    return;
  } else {
    alert("Invalid choice."); // if the user enters something else than 1, 2, 3 or 4 this alert will pop up. and the program will go back to the main menu and the enterings made by the user is still there

 // ==== Delete ====
function deleteList() {

 // ==== Export ====
function exportList() {

   if (data) {  // Check if there's actually data
    prompt("Copy this data: Ctrl+A -> Ctrl+C:", data);  // Show it in a prompt with the .copy I think it would automatically be in the clipboard. This I have no idea atm. 
  } else {
    alert("No data to export!");
    return;
  }
}    

 // ==== Import ====
function importList() {
  var data = prompt("Paste your words here:");  // User pastes the text, but it is not sorted.
   if (data) {
    localStorage.setItem("glossary", data);  // Save it same way as in addWord
    alert("List imported!");
  }

==============================
Notes will be put in readme
==============================

  // I dont know how to handle synonyms yet
  // but when I am inside the brackets I thought it could not get out to the rest of the program 
  // The fuction starts after the bracket - so "while (playing)" is outside the function?
  // The semicolon ; marks the end of a statement in JavaScript. The colon : means "continues" or "this belongs to that"
  // Will this be possible to run on github pages or does it need to be inside a same folder on the computer?
  // But what if i want to open up the program with the list from last session 
==============================
Updates will be published on github
==============================
