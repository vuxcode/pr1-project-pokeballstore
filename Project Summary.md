## Reflection on the Development Process

During development, the project went through a few iterations and a lot of trial and error. Early design choices caused problems later, especially using document.write, which broke the program. Replacing it with prompts and formatted strings made the program better. In the end, the “simple” design with prompt-based menus grew on me and now feels kind of cool. If I were to continue working on the project, I would keep the prompt-box style.

## What Could Be Improved with More Time

If I had more time, I would improve several parts of the project:

- **Menu navigation:** Jumping between menus is sometimes confusing. A clearer menu structure and more consistent returns to the menu the user expects would significantly improve usability.
- **Import validation:** The import function still relies on correct user input. Better validation (for example handling uneven word counts more safely) would prevent crashes. And import a full document with words.
- **Quiz flow:** The quiz works, but it could benefit from continuing after a correct answer (only one run), not back to the menu. Clearer exit options, scoring, and better feedback.
- **Code structure:** Make it more reusable. 
- **Error handling:** Many errors are handled with alerts, but more informative messages and safer checks could improve the user experience.

- Collin and vuxcode
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub and GitHub Pages
- Online documentation (MDN Web Docs, Stack Overflow, freeCodeCamp)
- AI assistance for deeper understanding.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a challenging but rewarding learning experience. While not all features are perfect. More importantly, the learning process itself, alot of including mistakes, dead ends, and problem solving, which was a valuable part of the project. 
I also learned that debugging often means **stepping back**, reading documentation, and sometimes reverting to an older version of the code to understand what changed. In some cases, I had to accept that a feature was beyond my current knowledge and leave it partially solved. The project, together with the course as a whole, helped me develop as a person in multiple ways. During the course, I went down many rabbit holes, and it also significantly improved my English proficiency.
